This tool processes mountain passes data in three steps:
        
1. Collection: Gathers and merges all CSV files containing pass data from the parent folder and all subfolders.
2. Conversion: Converts the collected data and transforms it to the correct coordinate system.
3. Filtering: Compares with known passes from Open Street Map database and keeps only the closest matches.

Parent folder is the folder from which the computer will look for all "mountain_passes.csv" in every child and subsequent folder.
"Reference passes" is the file from the public database Open Street Maps. For the alps it is in the downloaded folder.
Otherwise depending on the size of the region you are intersted into, look for OSM data download on the web.
Geofabric allows big downloads but you have to extract the info and create a .geojson file with only the passes.

Overpass turbo, smaller chunks, direct to geojsn but you need to recombine your chunks if you want to treat a big area.

Output will be saved in:
